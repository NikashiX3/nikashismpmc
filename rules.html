          <li class="rule"><b>Chat Abuse :</b><br>It is prohibited to use offensive language, make inappropriate jokes or topics, spread misleading information, or spam in any form (including switching between chat instances), and promote other servers. Excessive use of caps lock or trolling in the chat is also not allowed. Swearing is allowed, but it must not be directed toward other players. Hate speech, slurs, and excessive toxicity are not tolerated under any circumstances.</li>
          <li class="rule"><b>Threats :</b><br>Threatening, doxing, DDOSing, harassing, or extorting other players is prohibited. Sharing personal information or sending harmful links is also not allowed.</li>
          <li class="rule"><b>Unfair Advantage :</b><br>Using unauthorized modifications, abusing bugs, exploiting, scripting, or evading punishments is not allowed. All bugs or exploits found must be reported to the admin immediately.</li>
          <li class="rule"><b>Account Abuse :</b><br>Selling, trading, giving, or sharing accounts between players is prohibited. Any form of account abuse will be strictly dealt with. Using accounts that do not belong to the player, such as "borrowed" accounts, is also forbidden.</li>
          <li class="rule"><b>Game Trading :</b><br>Exchanging in-game content, items, currency, services, or accounts through unauthorized third-party platforms or external game trading platforms is prohibited. This extends to, but is not limited to, activities such as organizing or participating in games of chance, including gambling or setting up a casino on the server.</li>
          <li class="rule"><b>Inappropriate Content and Cosmetics :</b><br>Using inappropriate cloaks, skins, usernames, item names, tags, pet names, Housing content, Guild content, or any other inappropriate content is prohibited.

          <li class="rule"><b>Claim Trial Dungeon :</b><br>It is forbidden to claim any building or structure that contains a Trial Spawner. This means the area is open to the public and may not be claimed by anyone.</li>
          <li class="rule"><b>Mob Farm Management :</b><br>Mob Farms must have a proper management system, such as directing mob drops into storage like chests or barrels, to prevent mob drop items from piling up on the ground. Turn off the Mob Farm when not in use, such as by disabling the Mob Spawn flag in that Mob Farm.</li>
